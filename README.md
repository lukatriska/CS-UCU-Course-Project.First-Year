_Important_: In the video, when you reach 1:38, go to 3:10 to skip waiting.

**Even more important**: daily API usage is limited to 1000 requests per day, if you want to get more - head [here](https://darksky.net/dev/register), create your own account, API key, fill out the billing form and replace the old API key.

## The purpose of the data that I have collected is to be able to see the dynamic of change between:
1. Desired routes that user inputs
2. The weather on those routes
3. The particular time of year (and day) when it is the most safe and the most dangerous to travel
